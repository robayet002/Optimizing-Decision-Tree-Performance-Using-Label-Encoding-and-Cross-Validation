This project demonstrates a practical implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm for classification problems. The steps include:
Data Preprocessing: Converting categorical string data into numerical format using label encoding.
Model Training: Training a Decision Tree classifier on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model using cross-validation and generating a confusion matrix.

Features
Label Encoding: Convert categorical string features into numerical values.
Decision Tree Classifier: Implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm.
Cross-Validation: Evaluate the model's performance using k-fold cross-validation.
Confusion Matrix: Visualize the performance of the classification model.

Data Preparation
Ensure your dataset is in a CSV format. The target variable should be categorical.

Model Training and Evaluation
Train the Decision Tree classifier and evaluate it.

Results
Cross-Validation Score: Provides an estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.
